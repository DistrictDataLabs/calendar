## About

This tutorial was originally built by the instructors of the Georgetown Data Science Certificate (CCPE) to teach the basics of building a command line Python application. It has been forked by DDL instructors with permission for the same reason, though it diverges a bit to align with the DDL incubator cirriculum.
